For **data scientists, ML engineers**, and **AI researchers** who want to simplify feature engineering, manage complex dependencies, and boost productivity.

______________________________________________________________________

## Introduction

**Feature Fabrica** is an open-source Python library designed to improve engineering practices and transparency in feature engineering. It allows users to define features declaratively using YAML, manage dependencies between features, and apply complex transformations in a scalable and convenient manner.

By providing a structured approach to feature engineering, Feature Fabrica aims to save time, reduce errors, and enhance the transparency and reproducibility of your machine learning workflows. Whether you're working on small projects or managing large-scale pipelines, **Feature Fabrica** is designed to meet your needs.

## **Key Features**

- **üìù Declarative Feature Definitions**: Define features, data types, and dependencies using a simple YAML configuration.
- **üîÑ Transformations**: Apply custom transformations to raw features to derive new features.
- **üîó Dependency Management**: Automatically handle dependencies between features.
- **‚úîÔ∏è Pydantic Validation**: Ensure data types and values conform to expected formats.
- **üõ°Ô∏è Fail-Fast with Beartype**: Catch type-related errors instantly during development, ensuring your transformations are robust.
- **üöÄ Scalability**: Designed to scale from small projects to large machine learning pipelines.
- **üîß Hydra Integration**: Leverage Hydra for configuration management, enabling flexible and dynamic configuration of transformations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

### Installation

To install **Feature Fabrica**, simply run:

```bash
pip install feature-fabrica
```

### **Defining Features in YAML**

Features are defined in a YAML file. See examples in `examples/` folder. Here‚Äôs an example:

```yaml
feature_a:
  description: "Raw feature A"
  data_type: "int32"
  group: "training"

feature_b:
  description: "Raw feature B"
  data_type: "float32"
  group: "training"
  transformation:
    scale_feature:
      _target_: ().scale(factor=2)

feature_c:
  description: "Derived feature C"
  data_type: "float32"
  group: "training_experiment"
  dependencies: ["feature_a", "feature_b"]
  transformation:
    solve:
      _target_: (feature_a + feature_b) / 2

feature_e:
  description: "Raw feature E"
  data_type: "int32"
  group: "draft"
  transformation:
    _target_: ().upper().lower().one_hot(categories=['apple', 'orange'])
```

### **Creating and Using Transformations**

You can define custom transformations by subclassing the Transformation class:

```python
from feature_fabrica.transform import Transformation


class MyCustomTransform(Transformation):
    _name_ = "my_custom_transform"

    def execute(self, data):
        return data * 2
```

```yaml
feature_a:
  description: "Raw feature A"
  data_type: "int32"
  group: "training"
  transformation:
    _target_: ().my_custom_transform()
```

### **Compiling and Executing Features**

To compile and execute features:

```python
import numpy as np
from feature_fabrica.core import FeatureManager

data = {
    "feature_a": np.array([10.0], dtype=np.float32),
    "feature_b": np.array([20.0], dtype=np.float32),
}
feature_manager = FeatureManager(
    config_path="../examples", config_name="basic_features"
)
results = feature_manager.compute_features(data)
print(results["feature_c"])  # 0.5 * (10 + 20) = 15.0
print(results.feature_c)  # 0.5 * (10 + 20) = 15.0
```

### Visualize Features and Dependencies

Track & trace Transformation Chains

```python
import numpy as np
from feature_fabrica.core import FeatureManager

data = {
    "feature_a": np.array([10.0], dtype=np.float32),
    "feature_b": np.array([20.0], dtype=np.float32),
}
feature_manager = FeatureManager(
    config_path="../examples", config_name="basic_features"
)
results = feature_manager.compute_features(data)
print(feature_manager.features.feature_c.get_transformation_chain())
# Transformation Chain: (Transformation: sum_fn, Value: 30.0 Time taken: 9.5367431640625e-07 seconds) -> (Transformation: scale_feature, Value: 15.0, Time taken:  9.5367431640625e-07 seconds)
```

Visualize Dependencies

```python
from feature_fabrica.core import FeatureManager

feature_manager = FeatureManager(
    config_path="../examples", config_name="basic_features"
)
feature_manager.get_visual_dependency_graph()
```
